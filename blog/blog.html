      <h2>Gideon the Ninth</h2>
      <h5>Tasmyn Muir, Jan 10th, 2024</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="../imgs/gideoncover.jpg" alt="cover of the book Gideon the Ninth by Tasmyn Muir"></div>
      <p>"In the myriadic year of our Lord - the ten thousandth year of the King Undying, the kindly Prince of Death! - Gideon Nav packed her sword, her shoes, and her dirty magazines, and she escaped from the House of the Ninth." - page 1</p>
      <p>And it was with that opening line Tasmyn Muir had me hooked.<br><br>
		  
		 Gideon the Ninth is the first book in the Locked Tomb series, and it's a series full of Necromancy, Religious Trauma, and Memes. Our main character is sword weilding, himbo-esque, and sapphic. I love Gideon as a character because she is equally quick witted and dumb as a rock. On the otherhand, her counterpart in this series, Harrowhark Nonagesimus, is a tiny, spiteful, nun-let. We follow this unlikely dou as they basically go to a 'magick school' for necromancers - Harrow as the Necromancer and Gideon as her trusty 'cavalier' or protector. Harrow wants to become the next servant to the aforementioned King Undying, the kindly Prince of Death, Necromancer Prime (and like six other names). <br><br>
		  
		 Then things start to go wrong. Beecause of course they have to go wrong.<br><br>
		  
		 The relationship between Harrow and Gideon is one of my favorite things, because they downright hate eachother sometimes. Harrow spends a good portion of the book referring to Gideon as "Griddle" and in turn Gideon has a minor monologue about all the things she'd do for Harrow, which includes "The only job I’d do for you would be if you wanted your ass kicked so hard, the Locked Tomb opened and a parade came out to sing, ‘Lo! A destructed ass.’"<br><br>
		  
		 My other favorite part of this book is Tasmyn's amazing way of describing things. You get gems such as references to memes "She’s a genius. With the proper motivation, Griddle could wield two swords in each hand and one in her mouth. While we were developing common sense, she studied the blade. Am I right, Griddle?" This is a reference to a meme dating from 2016, "I studied the blade." As well as some beautifully descriptive language like  "Crux advanced on her like a glacier with an agenda." The VIBES!

      <h2>All of us Villians</h2>
      <h5>Amanda Foody and C. L. Herman, Aug 2nd, 2024</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="../imgs/villianscover.jpg" alt="cover of the book All of us Villians by Amanda Foody and C. L. Herman"></div>
      <p>A friend reccomended this book to me by saying it was Hunger Games and Harry Potter but make it gay.</p>
      <p>Reading through the first one was fun, but I always have a problem remembering names. Thankfully, my ability to make up random nicknames to remember whom is who is renouned - or at least known on one tiny corner of Tumblr where this book is puopular. Our main cast consist of four late teens, think 16/17 who are forced by a longstanding magical tournament to fight and kill one another so their family gets to keep the power. For the main POV cast we have:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Alistair - Scawy Monster</li>
			<li>Briony - Cheese Flower</li>
			<li>Isobel - NotBlondie McTragic</li>
			<li>Gavin</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The first book is mostly the social conflict and plot set up before this tournament takes place, you learn about each of these kids and a bit about their families. It does a lot to set up the world. The authors are very good at writing teenagers to be like teenagers. They make dumb rash decisions, they remember dumb fights with their 'ex friends', and at one point one of the girls magically fills her room with a swamp instead of talking to  her mother.<br><br>
		
		Overall, the plot is pretty see-through and obvious, but it makes up for it with the characters.
