			    Name: Dakota Harlow <br> Pronouns: She/They <br><br> Professionally, I am a motivated graphic designer. Passionate about accessibility and UX / UI design. Experience creating various designs for businesses within Brand Guides. Skilled in Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, and Design Principals. Always ready to Problem Solve and Learn. <br> <br>
			    Outside of work I love to read, I'm currently working through Piper CJ's body of work, starting with Deer and Dragon. <br> <br>
			    I also love gouache painting and recently have been enjoying glitter paints in my work - because why not? Recently I've been finding a passion in photography and was  gifted a 92 Nikon 6006, which is a film camera! I am almost done with my first reel of film and super excited to get it developed. <br> <br>
			    I have two cats, Arrow and Cinder. Cinder is grey, nine years old, and my little princess. Arrow is a black cat, three years old and has a weird medical condition where his body rejected all his teeth.
